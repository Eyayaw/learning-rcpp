My main goal in this educational endeavor is to be able to use the [MLPACK](http://www.mlpack.org/) library in R, with the hope of being able to include its Naive Bayes classifier in [MLPUGS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MLPUGS). Now, there is a [RcppMLPACK](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppMLPACK), but that one apparently uses version 1 of MLPACK (which is now in version 2) and doesn't include any supervised learning methods, just unsupervised learning methods.
