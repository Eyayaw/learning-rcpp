My main goal in this educational endeavor is to be able to use the [MLPACK](http://www.mlpack.org/), [Shark](http://image.diku.dk/shark/), and [dlib](http://dlib.net/) C++ machine learning libraries in R for computationally intensive problems. Now, there is a [RcppMLPACK](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppMLPACK), but that one apparently uses version 1 of MLPACK (which is now in version 2) and doesn't include any supervised learning methods, just unsupervised learning methods.
